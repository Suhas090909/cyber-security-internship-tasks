Network scanning using Nmap and basic port analysis
# CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP — Task 1

Objective: Scan your local network to discover open ports and analyze exposure.

Steps:
1. Install Nmap from the official website.
2. Find your local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
3. Run: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24` to perform a TCP SYN scan.
4. Note down IP addresses and open ports found.
5. Optionally analyze packet capture with Wireshark.
6. Research common services running on those ports.
7. Identify potential security risks from open ports.
8. Save scan results as text or HTML.

Outcome: Basic network reconnaissance skills; understanding of network service exposure.
